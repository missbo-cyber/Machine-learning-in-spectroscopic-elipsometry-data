# Introduction

The idea of this project is to choose a machine learning model to predict the thickness of SiO2 layers based on 
spectroscopic elipsometry data. There were three chosen model evaluated: Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Classifier and Random Forest Regression.

# Results

The efficiency of models was analysed based on mean squared error and R^2 score. Mean squared error is used to calculate teh average squared difference between the predicted and the actual target values within a dataset. The lower MSE, the better model. R^2 score is also used in linear regression models. It is the amount of the variation in the output dependent attribute which is predictable from the input independent variable. The closer to one, the better.
